When your vehicle reaches the maximum speed for a gear, you must:","answers":["Push the accelerator","Upshift","Downshift","Pump the brakes"],"correctAnswer":"Upshift"},{"id":2,"question":"3. When double clutching is done correctly, and the RPMs are matched during the shift:","answers":["It enables you to get in a rhythm with the engine","It gives you time to determine what gear comes next","It helps you wait for the 500 RPM change before changing gears","The gears do not grind"],"correctAnswer":"The gears do not grind"},{"id":3,"question":"4. Downshifting early is a common error that may:","answers":["Make it impossible to get into the next lower gear","Cause the clutch to burn out","Allow the engine to rev at low level, possibly causing the vehicle to stall","Make the clutch pop out forcefully"],"correctAnswer":"Make it impossible to get into the next lower gear"},{"id":4,"question":"5. The purpose of upshifting is to:","answers":["Match road speed with engine power","Allow the vehicle to increase speed","Slow down the vehicle","Transfer power from the transmission to the engine"],"correctAnswer":"Allow the vehicle to increase speed"},{"id":5,"question":"6. Proper, smooth shifting is important because if you shift before your vehicle is ready:","answers":["Your entire tractor-trailer may jerk forward","Your drive wheels may lock up momentarily","You could lose control of your vehicle","All answers are correct","All answers are incorrect"],"correctAnswer":"All answers are correct"},{"id":6,"question":"7. What actions negatively impact your vehicleâ€™s fuel economy?","answers":["Sitting in too low of a gear (causes the motor to bog down)","Using double clutching (causes the RPMs to drop too low)","Downshifting too early (causes the RPMs to jump up)","Using a heel-toe acceleration technique (causes the gears to slip)"],"correctAnswer":"Downshifting too early (causes the RPMs to jump up)"},{"id":7,"question":"8. With an autoshift transmission, if the transmission is in the drive position:","answers":["You will use a button to control to shift through all gears","Only the top gears will automatically change","It will shift gears as needed based on speed and load","Only the low gears will automatically change"],"correctAnswer":"It will shift gears as needed based on speed and load"},{"id":8,"question":"9. What is the primary difference between a manual and semiautomatic transmission?","answers":["The top gears automatically change in a semiautomatic transmission","A manual transmission uses electronic controls to help you shift","A semiautomatic transmission does not use a clutch and gearshift lever","The top gears automatically change in a manual transmission"],"correctAnswer":"The top gears automatically change in a semiautomatic transmission"},{"id":9,"question":"10. What does an automatic transmission use to change gears?","answers":["Lever or button","Range control lever","Torque converter","Accelerator analyzer"],"correctAnswer":"Lever or button"}]}
